# setup-scripts

These scripts are used to setup a pterodactyl panel with wings.

You do not need to run the panel setup scripts if you already have a panel setup, just host a wings daemon.

The entry point is the wings-install-docker.sh script and everything must be ran as root and in the same directory as everything else.
